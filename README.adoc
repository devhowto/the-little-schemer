== Chicken Scheme

I'm using link:https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Getting%20started[Chicken Scheme] with the link:http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/test[test egg] to work on the challenges.

== Emacs

Install link:https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/[Geiser].

On a buffer containing code/tests, do kbd:[M-x] `geiser`.

kbd:[C-c C-c] will either run tests or evaluate the expression (depends on where in the code _point_ is at the moment).
