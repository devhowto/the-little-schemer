=== function: `rember*'

.`rember*' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=rember*]

=== function: `insertR*'

.`insertR*' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=insertR*]
----

See <<first-commandment-final-version>>.

Both `rember*` and `insertR*` recur with `car` as well when it happens to be a list, as well as with the `cdr`.

All `*-functions' work on lists that are either:

- empty,
- an atom __cons__ed onto a list, or
- a list __cons__ed onto a list.

See <<fourth-commandment-final-version>>.


=== function: `occur*'

.`occur*' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=occur*]

1. Note the use of `+` to combine the result of the two recursive invocations.

=== function: `subst*'

.`subst*' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=subst*]
----

1. Note that `cons` the result of one recursive invocation onto the result of the other recursive invocation.

Besides that, we keep recurring with both `car` and `cdr` in these _star_ functions.


=== function: `insertL*'

.`insertL*' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=insertL*]
----


=== function: `member*'

.`member*' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=member*]
----

Pay attention the use of `or` in the combination part of the `atom?` an `else` questions.


=== function: `leftmost'

.`leftmost' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=leftmost]
----

1. Since it is assumed `l' is not empty, it is not necessary to ask `(null? l)`.


=== function: `eqlist?'

Each argument may be either

- empty,
- an atom __cons__ed onto a list, or
- a list __cons__ed onto a list.

.`eqlist?' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=eqlist?]
----

1. If both are null, then we don't even get to the next question (`or`).
2. If we get to this question, then at least one of the above was not null (we used `and`) and if now one happens to be null (we are using `or`) then we know the lists are not equal.


=== function: `my-equal?'

.`my-equal?' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=my-equal?]
----

Note that we used `eqlist?` to define `my-equal?`.


=== function: `eqlist? (v2)'

.`eqlist? (v2)' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=eqlist?-v2]
----

See <<sixth-commandment>>.


=== function: `rember (v2)'

.`rember (v2)' function definition
[source,scheme,lineos]
----
include::./definitions.scm[tag=rember-v2]
