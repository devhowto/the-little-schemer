=== About Sets

A Set is an unordered collection of objects without duplicates.

Two sets are the same if they have the same members (which may be in different order).

A subset is a set in which its members are part of another set. Two equal sets also mean that one set is a subset of the other, and vice-versa.

Two sets intersect if they contain at least one common member.

The union of two sets is the combination of elements in both sets.

Note that `subset?` uses `and`, and `intersect?` uses `or`, otherwise they are the same thing.

Pay attention to those instances where we don't return an empty list for the base case (as in those number-related function in which we returned `n` instead of `0`).

A list of pairs can have duplicates, but a set cannot. A Relation cannot have the same element `x' twice in the same position of the relation's pairs. I.e:

----
'((a b) (b a)) ;; OK, a relation.
'((a b) (a b)) ;; Oops! Not really a relation.
----

A list of pairs is a _function_ if all `firsts` produce a Set (a set is an unordered collection of elements without duplicates).

A finite function is a list of pairs in which no first element of any pair is the same as any other first element.

=== function: `fun?'

=== function: `revrel'

We are going to use the helper functions `first` and `second` instead of doing everything with `car` and `cdr`.

=== function: `revpair'

----

=== function: `revrel' (v2)

By using `revpair` as a helper function, we can write a new, more consice and elegant version of `revrel`.

=== function: `fullfun?'

A `fullfun` is a function where, besides being a `fun?`, no pair have the same second element.

The `fullfun?` function is not hard to write if we use other functions has helpers, like `set?` and `second`.

=== function: `one-to-one?'

`fullfun?` could have also been named `one-to-one?` because it also makes sense (if you know Set Theory, that is). And one could rewrite it as follows...
