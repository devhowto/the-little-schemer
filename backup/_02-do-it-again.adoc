== 2. Do it Again and Again

`'()` is a `lat?` because it doesn't contain a list (even though it doesn't contain any atom either, but that is their definition).


=== function: `lat?'

- `(cond ...)` asks questions
- `(lambda ...)` creates a function; and
- `(define ...)` gives the function a name.

If the value of `(atom? (car l))` is `#t`, then the value of the entire function is `(lat? (cdr l))`.

`(lat? (cdr l))` asks if the rest of the list is composed only of atoms, invoking the function with a new argument.

=== function: `member?'
