== 0 :: Setup

I ran code and played with repl sessions with Chicken Scheme, Emacs + Geiser and wrote the summary in Asciidoctor.

Chicken Scheme has its own `atom?`. It returns `#t` for `'()`. The version from the book is:

=== function: `atom?'

.atom? function definition
[source,scheme]
----
;;;;
;; atom? :: Value -> Bool
;;
;; Checks whether `x` is an atom.
;;
;; The default Chicken Scheme `atom?` implementation returns `#t` for
;; `'()`, but the book wants the empty list to NOT be considered an
;; atom. Therefore, the `atom?` implementation from the book.
;;
(define atom?
  (lambda (x)
    (and (not (pair? x)) (not (null? x)))))
